## ðŸ‘€ Introduction

1.  **What's this?**

    The following repository is a template model created for education purposes or inspiration. The template is created from a tutorial I followed on https://pusher.com/tutorials/code-playground-react/. 


2.  **What's the plan?**

I would like to push beyond the basics and expand this project into something like code pen and play around with the bugs I found.
